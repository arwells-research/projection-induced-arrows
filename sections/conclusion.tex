\section{Conclusion}

We presented a minimal, trajectory-first constraint framework in which arrow-like directedness arises
as an inevitable feature of operational descriptions anchored at conditioning boundaries.
Under time-reversal symmetric admissible dynamics and fixed information-losing projections,
direction-sensitive diagnostics are constrained to be boundary-radial. Unique intrinsic
arrows require additional explicitly asymmetric assumptions.

This reframes arrow puzzles as questions about operational cuts and boundary selection,
rather than about fundamental temporal directedness in the underlying admissible structure itself.
